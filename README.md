# Disaster Tweets Classification

## Project Context
I developed this project as a practical assignment for the **Data Science** course within the *Ingeniería en Informática* degree at *Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA)*. This work was done during the second semester of 2025.
The objective was to apply key concepts from the course by participating in a Kaggle machine learning competition.

The project consists of four parts:
1. Data Analysis and Visualization
2. Machine Learning Baseline
3. Machine Learning Models: XGBoost and RandomForest
4. Extras

## Dataset
This project uses the dataset from the Kaggle competition **"Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets"**:  
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started

To run the notebooks or reproduce the experiments, you must download the following files directly from the competition page:

- `train.csv`
- `test.csv`
- `sample_submission.csv`

Place these files in the root of the repository (or adjust the paths as needed).
